% == Find range bin of each chirp ==
% This function will detect the range bin for each chirp. The bin is found
% as the peak of highest magnitude within each chirp. Because there is
% always a peak from the tx antenna the function skips the first few
% data points of each chirp which corresponds to this peak. We might want
% to rewrite this if we do measurements closer to the body
%
% If 'graph' is set to 1 the detected peak of each chirp will be shown in
% a plot, the plot has a slider to navigate through all chirps. If set to 0
% the plot will not be shown.
%
% Inputs:
% num_frames = number of frames/chirps of the meas 
% num_samples = number of ADC samples per chirp
% T_f = the periodicity of chirps
% fft_magnitude = the magnitudes of the FFT
% graph = flag to graph detected peaks
%
% Outputs:
% possible_bins = list of possible bins that have a detected peak
% selected_bin = the bin that is detected most often
